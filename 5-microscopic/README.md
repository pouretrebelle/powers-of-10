# Study 5 – Microscopic – A1

## Setup

This program relies on the http method fetch to get the shader code, and thus can only be run locally with a server. Below are two methods to launch a simple server, depending on having python or php installed respectively.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
php -S localhost:8000
```

After running one of these commands the demo should be visible at [localhost:8000](localhost:8000). Alternatively check out the demo on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pouretrebelle/project/full/3ca8f0f155cdf231996c36abfee72c56/AkmQqZ/).
